# Arithmetic Operators in C++
- Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations with basic variables such as integers and floating-point numbers

### Addition Operator
- It adds 2 numbers together    
`int sum = a + b;`

### Subtraction Operator
- It subtracts one number from another    
`int difference = a - b;`  

### Multiplication Operator
- It multiplies two numbers together    
`int product = a * b;`  

### Division Operator
- It divides one number by another
- If both operands are integers, it will perform integer division and the result will be an integer
`int quotient = a / b;` -> Integer division   
`float quotient = float (a) / float (b);` -> Floating-point division   

### Modulus Operator
- It calculates the remainder of an integer division  
`int remainder = a % b;`
