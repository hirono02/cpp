# Operators in C++
- Operators in C++ are symbols that perform various operations on data
- They are used to manipulate and evaluate expressions and variables
- Commonly used operator types in C++ includes:
    - **Arithmetic Operators**: These are used for performing arithmetic operations
        - `+`: addition
        - `-`: subtraction
        - `*`: multiplication
        - `/`: division
        - `%`: modulo (remainder)
    - **Comparison (Relational) Operators**: These are used to compare 2 values and return true or false based on the comparison
        - `==`: equal to
        - `!=`: not equal to
        - `<`: less than
        - `>`: greater than
        - `<=`: less than or equal to
        - `>=`: greater than or equal to    
    - **Logical Operators**: These operators are used to perform logical operations
        - `&&`: logical AND
        - `||`: logical OR
        - `!`: logical NOT
    - **Assignment Operators**: These operators are used to assign values to variables
        - `=`: simple assignemnt
        - `+=`: addition assignemnt
        - `-=`: subtraction assignemnt
        - `*=`: multiplication assignemnt
        - `/=`: division assignemnt
        - `%=`: modulo assignemnt
